# Context Collapse

## Instructions to build and run

Make sure you have npm installed, then from the root directory:

$ npm i
$ npm i elm
$ npm start

You'll need to have a stable internet connection in order for the elm build
script to download all its dependencies and compile successfully.

The project will tell you what port it's running on (e.g.
http://localhost:8888/). Once compilation succeeds, you can then navigate
there in your browser to see the project.
