at work tonight to avoid dying of boredom._)

Never heard from you... pretty bummed, are we not good?

Anyway, um... I guess maybe I'm gonna check out for awhile. Let me know
if you want to make some music, ball's in your court D.


## latermaybe
! from A |> to Me

Happens, thanks for the heads up. It worked out, though, Jenny really needed
another pair of hands tonight.

If you end up deciding your up for a low-key drink, I'll be at the bar 'till
closing.

Okay - I wanna try recording this time night,
so make sure to bring the sex.

Good practice! Same time next week?

! [Yes] |> to A >>
    Sure thing! Unless you've got a night off this weekend
    and want to try to record that tricky bridge again while
    it's still fresh on our minds.

! [Maybe] |> to A >>
    I'll have to see, next week's busy. Thanks for being flexible
    with my flaky ass, as always.

Good... uh... practice, I guess?
